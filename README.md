Microcontroller-based mobile robot built in the early 2000s.

Didn't have a laptop at the time, so instead I used about 5 different microcontrollers that handled separate functions. It had a speech recognition module, speech synthesis module, and a CMU cam for color blob tracking. A BASIC Stamp II in the head and an OOPic II in the torso tied everything together. The robot was able to respond to simple commands like "look for blue". I think it was loosely inspired by the Heathkit Hero 2000 robot.
